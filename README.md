This simple application serves the purpose of learning how to integrate the following gems and their associated functionalities together:

```ruby
    gem 'rails-i18n'
    gem 'rspec-rails'
    gem 'capybara'
    gem 'capybara-screenshot-diff'
    gem 'selenium-webdriver'
	gem 'poltergeist'
```

Application permits ability to conduct comprehensive acceptance testing for localization.
